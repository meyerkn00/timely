Title: Creates timely() function to write output filenames with fewer steps
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Karl Meyer
Maintainer: Karl Meyer <karl@themeyers.org>
Description: The timely() function uses user inputs and the local time in order to create a file name.
    Many times when a user wants to create a filename, they may just want a name, extension, and timestamp. Currently
  the process for creating such a name involves nested functions within write(), such as paste0() and format(). This
  package turns that into one function with sensible defaults to make this process easier.
